# HouseRentPrediction
This project focuses on predicting the rent of a house using Machine Learning techniques. The goal of the project is to build a powerful model that can predict the rent of a house based on its various features. 
The approach I have went with here is stack two powerful models - Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and create an Ensemble model. 
The dataset used here is sourced from Kaggle.
